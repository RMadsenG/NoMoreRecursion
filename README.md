# Non Recursive Calculations
## A "highly" efficient method of rewriting recursive algorithms using loops instead

When we are first introduced to recursion in school, we are taught that loops are usually faster than recursion.
If you can easily write a function using loops instead of recursion, we are told that you should.

This is my attempt at redoing common recursive algorithms using loops instead of recursion for "maximum" speed.
