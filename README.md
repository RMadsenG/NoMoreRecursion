# Fibonacci and Factorial Calculation 
## A "highly" efficient method of calculating the fibonacci sequence and factorials
Factorials and the fibonacci sequence are the standard intruductory problems when a CS student is first introduced to recursion.

We are then quickly taught that recursion is very slow, and when it can be avoided, it should be.

This is my attempt at redoing these problems using loops instead of recursion for maximum speed.
